```c
FILE *fpin, *fpout;
fpin = fdopen(sockfd, "r");
fpout = fdopen(sockfd, "w");

// read and write

fclose(fpin);
fclose(fpout);
```

For example: Socket Descripter 'fd' was uesed by thread1 for write, thread2 for
read. When thread1 close the stream, fd is released to be reused. Then tread3
create a Socket Descripter 'fd2' whose value is the same as fd. But The stream in Thread2 has not been closed, it will serve for the new opened socket,and confuse us.
