A.

$$
s_2 = s_1 - [ (n * 8 + 30) \& 0XFFFFFFF0 ]
$$

when n is odd

$$
s_2 = s_1 - (n * 8 + 24)
$$

when n is even

$$
s_2 = s_1 - (n * 8 + 16)
$$

B.

$$
p = (s_2 + 15) \& 0XFFFFFFF0
$$

the least multiple of 16 that greater than s2

Base on the alignment principleï¼Œthe address of variable 'i' must be multiple of 8, 's1=&i-16' must be multiple of 8, 's2=s1-16x' must be multiple of 8. since p is multiple of 16 and e2=p-s2 , so e2 must be 8 or 0 other than 15 or any other values. when e2 is 8 and n is even, e1 get it's min value 8 on 'e1+e2=16'. when e2 is 0 and n is odd, e1 get it's max value 24 on 'e1+e2=24'.


D.

p is aligned by 16

s2 is the least multiple of 16 that preserve 8*n size space
